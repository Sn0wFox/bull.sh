:cow: A website for a school project

## Context

The aim of the project was to act like my team and I were in the position
of creating a startup, in order to apply the skills we learned in the fields of
management, economy, communication and social responsibility.

We came up with the idea of a tool able measure how much a talk could be
corrupted and prone to trick people hearing/reading it, lexically and linguistically speaking.

Despite the fact that we won't release such a tool,
we did everything as if we really were, meaning:
- Business plan
- Marketing studies
- Communication plan
- ...

The present website is meant to be a showcase / business website,
and will include all the documents listed above, and more.

## Template
